# Parallel Motif-Based Community Detection
### Authors: Tianyi Chen (ctony@bu.edu) and Charalampos E. Tsourakakis (ctsourak@bu.edu)  

This repository contains the code for the paper "Parallel Motif-Based Community Detection" that focuses on finding communities in large-scale networks. Despite the large number of methods such as Louvain and Infomap, scalability remains a major issue due to the sheer increase in the size of graphs~\cite{shi2021scalable}.   In recent years, a motif-based community detection paradigm has emerged, which has resulted in state-of-the-art methods such as Tectonic that stand out for their ability to detect communities by selectively pruning edges based on a motif-based similarity score and then outputting the resultant connected components.
